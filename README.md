# MY NEOVIM CONFIG

Config based on the nvim kickstart setup. I'll be modifying it as I continue to code. This configuration is intended to provide a flexible and efficient development environment. My primary goal is to be able to code and move around very fast. As I explore different plugins and features, I will continue to refine and enhance this setup._I don't recommend anyone using this config yet, as I am still learning and experimenting._
